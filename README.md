# Functional Degeneracy and Attainable Optimality Under Execution Delay

This repository contains the research materials for a position paper on
delayed decision-making under noise and frictions.

The paper argues that performance limitations in delayed systems are often
driven by benchmark mismatch rather than algorithmic insufficiency, and
introduces *functional degeneracy*—the multiplicity and temporal persistence
of ε-optimal decisions—as a structural explanation.
