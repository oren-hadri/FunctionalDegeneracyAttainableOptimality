**Functional Degeneracy and Attainable Optimality Under Execution Delay**  
Oren Hadri (2026)

The paper studies delayed decision-making under noise and frictions, arguing that
performance limitations in such systems are often driven by benchmark mismatch
rather than algorithmic insufficiency. It introduces *functional degeneracy*—the
multiplicity and temporal persistence of ε-optimal decisions—as a structural
explanation for when stable, selective policies are attainable under delay.
