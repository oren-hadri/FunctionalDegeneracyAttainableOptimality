# Experimental Code

This directory contains code used to generate the illustrative experiments
reported in Section 4 of the paper.

The code is provided for reproducibility and transparency only.
It is not intended to be a trading system, a predictive model,
or a production-ready implementation.

All experiments operate on historical data and perform ex post evaluation.
No live execution, exchange connectivity, or real-time decision-making
is implemented.
